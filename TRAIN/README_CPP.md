# C++

The [main README](../README.md) sits in the parent directory.

Please see the [train README](README.md) for the general methods and algorithms used for training.

According to Bjarne Stroustrup:

> "C++ is for people who want to use hardware really well and then manage the complexity of doing that through abstraction."

## Build with C++17

The build environment for this project is rather simple, is wholly coded in [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) and is made of 10 scripts.

* ***analyze.sh*** analyzes the C++ source file provided with [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.net) and [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy).
* ***build.sh*** simply calls *compile.sh* then *analyze.sh* with the C++ source file provided.
* ***compile.sh*** compiles the C++ source file provided with multiple versions of clang++ and g++, to help debug complex compilation problems and allow to performance-test multiples compilers.
* ***documentAll.sh*** invokes documenter [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl) with parameter file **Doxyfile**.
* ***executablesDelete.sh*** simply deletes all the executables generated by *compile.sh* and *run.sh*.
* ***executablesList.sh*** simply lists all the executables generated by *compile.sh* and *run.sh*.
* ***flags.sh*** defines in a single file **all** compile, warnings, analyze and tidy flags and is sourced by *analyze.sh*, *compile.sh* and *run.sh*.
* ***formatAll.sh*** *clang-formats* all .cpp and .hpp C++ source files, stype *Mozilla* is used.
* ***include.sh*** simply defines a few utilities and is included in other bash scripts.
* ***run.sh*** compiles the C++ source file provided with only one compiler and if on no error, then runs the corresponding executable.
